                            My name is <b>Warren Van Zuydam</b>. I
                            created this personal website mainly to show off my random skills, all
                            aggregated into one central space,
                            for
                            either anyone looking to
                            employ me full-time, or any potential freelance clients or customers. I'm a
                            self-taught web developer, graphic designer, and a freelance general transcriptionist with over
                            3 years of experience. All the graphics, this
                            website's looks, functions, the services I offer, the products I sell... All of this is done
                            by me.
                            If you need an audio transcription done, or a website like mine built from scratch in plain
                            HTML,
                            CSS and
                            JavaScript, a digital template... I am here to help out. Above, you'll find
                            links to
                            my socials, so you know exactly who I am. My main roles are transcription (for freelance work),
                            and graphic design (for full-time employment, though I am thinking of offering this as a
                            freelance service too). All my other "skills" are more hobbies than anything, but hey, if
                            you like my hobbies, then I can make a plan to extend my services. I am very versatile when it
                            comes to computers. I can solve most problems, I can pick up programs very
                            quickly, and I can obsess over my current interest. One day I'm teaching myself Python coding, the
                            next day, I'm sharpening on my vector graphic design skills, and the other day, I'm messing
                            around with websites.

                            I hope someone will take notice of my list of random skills and interests, and perhaps
                            find a way to make use of me in their business. I hope to get hired either as a freelancer,
                            or better, a full-time employee. I don't really care what I do, but I need something to get
                            my life going. For a long time, I struggled to settle on one interest to become a master at
                            it, in order to be able to turn it into a living. I am always thinking "What if I did this
                            instead? This looks cool and interesting". As you can tell by now, I have a severe case of
                            "Shiny Object Syndrome".
