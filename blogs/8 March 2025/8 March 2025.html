                            Before we get into today's topic, it is important to be VERY careful what you search for,
                            click, download, receive in your email's inbox, etc. Letting your guard down for even a few
                            moments can put your online accounts, and PC/mobile device at massive risk. In most cases,
                            it can turn your real life upside down!

                            Info stealers have become THE most common form of cyber attack today, with ransomware
                            following closely behind. Info stealers come in a few forms, namely, phishing emails
                            containing links to malicious websites asking for your email address and passwords,
                            downloaded executable files, and even ordinary-looking files, like .svg, .html, .pdf, and
                            .docx files (with malicious macros). So what does an info stealer do? An info stealer's
                            purpose is to steal the victims' crypto wallets, online accounts, banking information, and
                            more. A downloaded malicious file can easily hide from your anitvirus using clever tactics,
                            such as being large in file size, hiding malicious code by only linking and executing off
                            from a malicious website, hiding in a password-protected zip file, etc. Once the stolen data
                            is harvested, the hacker (likely just a script kiddie) will sell it on the dark web for a
                            quick buck. If another hacker purchases your stolen data and accounts, they can then use it
                            for their own nefarious purposes, such as spreading crypto scams, sending your contacts
                            phishing emails, identity theft, etc.

                            Whether you're on Windows, MacOS, or Linux, you should always keep you file manager's file
                            view in some form of "detailed list mode". The name of this feature will be different
                            depending on your file manager you use. Switching your view from "large tiles" to "list
                            mode" allows you to not only see the fake icon, but also the file's true extension name, and
                            the file's size. Never trust a file name and an icon on its own. The file extension and size
                            are the most important. If a file is abnormally large, or the icon doesn't match the
                            extension type, you should start to grow very suspicious of that file. Delete it
                            immediately. Do not even try to scan the file to see if it's "safe" for opening. False
                            negatives are far too common. Also know that hackers like to hide their malicious executable
                            in large tile mode by givng it a fake extension, that will hide the true extension, such as
                            "totallynotavirus.pdf.exe" for example. The last extension is always the true extension the
                            computer uses to open the file. The first extension (.pdf) in this example will make it
                            APPEAR as an acutal PDF file in large tile mode.

                            About The Biggest Security Threat Of The Modern Day - Web Browsers</p>
                        <p style="color: #000000; margin-left: 2rem; margin-right: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem">
                            You are likely aware that data such as your browsing history exists. You maybe even heard of
                            "cookies". Many websites will ask you to accept third party cookies, which is questionable
                            in terms of privacy, but it's not a security threat. However, there is another type of
                            cookie which almost nobody ever talks about, or even knows about, and that is a "session
                            cookie". Have you ever logged into a website for the first time, only to then be
                            automatically logged in the next time you visit that website? You can thank your session
                            cookie for granting you access to your account on that website. And THIS, ladies and
                            gentlemen, is what hackers are after. There are "session tokens as well", which have a
                            similar purpose, but let's stick with the name "session cookie" for now for simplicity sake.
                            Cookies are stored locally in your browser, and can be seen by pressing F12, and navigating
                            through the developer settings within your browser, until you find your browser's local
                            storage. It is recommended to clear your browser's history, cookies, etc. at least once per
                            week. The reason why info stealers and hackers love to target victims' session cookies, is
                            that these cookies accumulate over the months, or even years of the victim using their web
                            browser. Many ordinary people never clear this data from their browsers, and thus, create a
                            bigger potential "blast radius" for themselves if they DO ever get hacked by an info
                            stealer. By regularly flushing out these locally stored cookies from your web browser, you
                            dramatically decrease the blast radius of a potential attack, because the hacker will have
                            little-to-no access to your online accounts. Be aware though, that if you're signed into
                            Google, all your Google platforms (Drive, Gmail, YouTube, Photos, etc.) will be at risk of
                            an attack. It is recommended to always sign out of Google (Gmail), or Microsoft (Outlook)
                            when you don't need these accounts and their services. Any website you log into and use,
                            should then be logged out of when you no longer need it. This will delete your session
                            cookies/tokens, but just to be on the safe side (If you forget to log out of a website),
                            clear your cookies as well, just for in case there are any residual cookies/tokens.
                            Remember, that any convenience you are given in a web browser, comes at a security cost.
                            Convenience IS a security threat, and there's unfortunately nothing we can do about it. You
                            win some, you lose some. Being more secure means sacrificing convenience. This also means
                            NOT using any ol' browser extension/plugin! These small programs are another popular thing
                            for hackers to take advantage of. They'll fake the number of downloads, the reviews, etc. to
                            appear "trustworthy". You can't even trust a "verified" badge, because Google, or Microsoft
                            can always overlook threats, and accidentally verify them as "trustworthy"
                            extensions/plugins. I bet you're probably thinking that this whole cybersecurity thing is a
                            deep rabbithole. And it is. Let's move on with the next heading.

                            password, which the hackers can then harvest to then take over your email address, or other
                            online accounts). Rather check the website itself for any security notifications. If you
                            cannot access your online account to verify the legitimacy of that email, then that email IS
                            probably legit, and you might as well click the link to reset your password and secure your
                            account. This is a clever trick that will spare you a lot of headache.<br><br>

                            - Emails from an unknown source asking you to download a file.<br><br>
                            - Blackmail Bitcoin scams (These emails threaten to release sensitive footage of you
                            doing... "freaky" things on your phone or computer to all your contacts, unless you send the
                            scammer an arbitrary amount of Bitcoin to their crypto wallet address).<br><br>
                            - Emails that claim you need to pay some "fee" for some package in transit. If you know you

                            themself as, then AVOID this email.

                            Email spoofing is the art of faking an email address to look like it comes from the real
                            source. Just because the email address is spelled the same as the legit email address, be
                            very careful. Hackers just have to swap out a Latin "e" for a Cyrillic "e" to appear like
                            the real deal. Can you tell the difference between the two characters? Not with a naked eye,
                            no. That's all it takes for hackers to fool people into believing the email address is
                            legit. There are websites out there that help you find out whether an email address is
                            spoofed or not.

                            - It is never a good idea to keep all your eggs in one basket. Using the same email address
                            for everything is one of the worst things you can do. If a hacker manages to take over your
                            email address (And for some reason you can't recover your account), then everything is gone.
                            Rather split your online accounts into different email address categories (Such as a
                            business email, a Google products email, a Microsoft products email, a private email for
                            other online accounts, a public email for legal, employment or medical purposes,
                            etc.)<br><br>
                            - Never EVER save passwords, banking information, home addresses, etc. in your web browser
                            when asked. Hackers are well-aware of this convenience, and they'll attempt to steal this
                            information, along with your session cookies and tokens.<br><br>
                            - Never EVER use the same password for multiple accounts. If one of your passwords are
                            found, hackers can do something devastating, called "credential stuffing", where they would
                            test out all of your online accounts, and possibly take them over. If you happen to be one
                            of these victims, then prepare for a long, stressful, bumpy ride of securing and recovering
                            your accounts. Fun fact, I was one of these people.<br><br>
                            - Use Linux instead of Windows or MacOS (Most attacks are only designed to target Windows or
                            MacOS users). Keep in mind that Linux is not 100% safe either, however, it does a good job
                            at dramatically reducing your attack surface. Linux's desktop market share is still far too
                            low to be attractive to hackers. Hackers want to target the largest, least tech-savvy group
                            of people, and Windows and MacOS users fit that profile very well. Linux users tend to be
                            more security and privacy-conscious than the average person. Hackers find it a waste of time
                            to hack these people in most cases. There are still Linux threats targeting desktop users,
                            but most Linux attacks take place in the server space.<br><br>
                            - Use free and open source software ("FOSS" for short). Do NOT attempt to pirate software.
                            If you can't afford a piece of software, rather be safe than sorry. Fun fact, this is why I
                            got hacked myself a while back. I used the same passwords for everything, and I thought I
                            could pirate software from a YouTube "tutorial". I used a popular operating system called
                            "Windows 11" (Which allowed the Windows-only malware to execute). I also never cleared my
                            browser's session cookies, so that was a MASSIVE concoction of mistakes on my end. I know
                            better now, and this is the reason why I wrote this blog. I want to protect people from
                            getting hacked like I did many months ago.<br><br>
                            - Use flatpaks as much as possible (Linux only). This is a sandboxed packaging format that
                            is not only more secure, but prevents dependency issues on Linux, increasing system
                            stability.<br><br>
                            - Encrypt your hard drive (Don't do this with Windows, unless you know for a fact what your
                            Bitlocker key is. You can find this key buried somewhere deep within your Microsoft
                            account's settings).<br><br>
                            - Use a strong PC login password.<br><br>
                            - Always generate long, and strong passwords using uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols,
                            and perhaps even extended ASCII symbols (Extended ASCII is not going to work on most
                            websites). When it comes to passphrases, never use words or phrases that make sense, because
                            passphrases can be vulnerable to something called "dictionary attacks", which allows hackers
                            to crack passphrases. If you REALLY NEED to use a passphrase, create something random, like
                            "tyrestwosomebottlebirdcar". Mixing in multiple languages in one passphrase can make it even
                            harder to crack. Also replace some letters with symbols and numbers, so it's essentially
                            just as complex as a normal password.<br><br>
                            - Use a privacy-respecting browser (Brave, Librewolf and Mullvad are good examples). Keep in
                            mind that some websites may not work properly, or even break, because your browser is
                            blocking fingerprinting, JavaScript, ads, etc.<br><br>
                            - Use a privacy-respecting search engine (StartPage, DuckDuckGo, MetaGer, Mojeek, SearXNG,
                            Swisscows, Ecosia, etc. are good alternatives to Google and Bing). Keep in mind that image
                            search, Google SEO, sublinks, etc. will not work properly, or break on these search engines.
                            You win some, you lose some.<br><br>
                            - ALWAYS use a password manager... but NOT the one built into your web browser! Use password
                            managers like Bitwarden (online), or KeepassXC (local/offine). For Android, you can use
                            KeePassDX, or Keepass2Android to read the exact same database file that KeePassXC (Desktop)
                            can read (Beware of fake apps). I recommend using a local password manager, because I'd
                            rather trust in myself than some random company with all my passwords. Local password
                            managers save a database file to your computer or mobile device, which is usually encryped
                            using AES 256-bit (The gold standard form of encryption). It is impossible to crack these
                            database files without the master password and/or keyfile. A keyfile is an optional MFA
                            feature for your database file, which acts as a virtual key to your database. This file is
                            generated once, and doesn't need updating. So even if someone manages to gain access to your
                            password database file, they would need the master password AND physical access to the
                            keyfile to decrypt the database file. Even if a hacker has installed a keylogger onto your
                            computer (to record your master password), AND they have your database file on their
                            computer, they would STILL need that keyfile. This is an extreme form of password security,
                            and honestly, I prefer it to the online password managers. I might not be a celebrity, but I
                            can never have enough security over my passwords. Unlike online password managers, it is
                            your responsibility to keep your database updated across all your devices and storage
                            drives. You CAN keep your database on cloud storage, but keep your keyfile offline, stored
                            across all your devices. Keep all devices updated with the latest version of your database.
                            Always keep a local backup of your database too. Choose a primary device to make the latest
                            changes, upload it, then have your other devices download the latest version of the
                            database. Or... you could just store it locally. It's up to you how to keep your database
                            updated and shared across devices.

                            It is always a good idea to educate oneself on cybersecurity and privacy. Remember, security
                            comes first, THEN you may worry about privacy. As with anonymity, unless you're some
                            whistleblower, or a wanted criminal the government is after, you don't have to worry about
                            anonymity. Always clear your cookies and other site data on all your browsers (PC and
                            mobile), and be very suspicious of any unusual emails you receive, or files you want to
                            download. NO VPN service will protect you from threats, contrary to popular belief. If a
                            company says their VPN service will protect you from hackers, run FAR away, and don't give
                            them your money and data (Yes, VPNs are just a way to transfer your real IP address from
                            your ISP to some random company that logs your connections anyways). Free VPNs are to be
                            ESPECIALLY avoided. Remember, if you don't pay for something, YOU ARE the product. Hackers
                            in anyway don't even need your IP address to cause harm. It's actually one of the least
                            reliable data points for a hacker. Okay, bye now. Nobody will ever be 100% safe, but
                            reducing attack surface is always SOMETHING.
