                            Imagine a metaphorical mirror. Imagine you're holding the mirror, looking at your face. What
                            kind of person do you see? No, really, do you see a truly good person, or do you see someone
                            with moral issues? No... Forget religion for a second, because you don't need religion to be
                            a good person. Forget the silly, made-up rules your one religion out of thousands made up. Do you...

                            Monopoly, I think the rich aren't being taxed as they should be, I already respected
                            homosexuality, etc. So what was my problem? My problem was that I was trying to shoehorn myself in with the wrong side. I live in a very conservative (homophobic, transphobic, pro-poverty, pro-ultra rich, religious, exploitative, sexist, unloving)
