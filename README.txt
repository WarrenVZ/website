This website folder is called "website", because there is JavaScript code that is trying to read your GitHub
repo name, and your repo name is called "website". If you change your repo name, you will have to update
all these files! DO NOT RENAME THIS FILE! Also, keep in mind that the offline website will not have working
navigation menu links, but once uploaded to live, it will work, so when editing, you'll have to manually
navigate to the webpage you want to edit.
