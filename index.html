                            Hi, I'm <b style="color: #272727;">Warren Van Zuydam</b>. I
                            created this personal website, mainly to show off my random skills, host my portfolio,
                            blogs, etc. This website is for anyone looking to
                            either employ me full-time, or hire me for my freelance services. <br><br>
                            I'm a self-taught web developer, graphic designer, and a freelance general transcriptionist
                            with over
                            3 years of experience. This website is built by me, using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I
                            can do a large variety of things with computers to solve different problems. If you haven't
                            noticed, I am a "DIY"
                            type of guy, so I will do anything and everything I take interest in, as long as it involves
                            a computer.

                            My Qualifications:</p>
                        <p style="color: #272727; margin-left: 2rem; margin-right: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem">
                            <b style="color: #272727;">I'm a qualified structural draughtsman</b>. I have experience in
                            AutoCAD, Tekla, Revit, and
                            Microstation. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the proprietary software, so this field
                            has been really difficult
                            to get into, due to the pricing, and the lack of safe, free alternatives. <br> <br>
                            <b style="color: #272727;">I'm a qualified TEFL teacher</b> (English teacher). I completed
                            my 120-hour TEFL theoretical
                            course, as well as my 20-hour practical course. I learned the fundamentals of managing a
                            classroom, teaching students in fun and
                            engaging ways, how to use Zoom, its whiteboard functionality, breakout rooms, etc. I am
                            still open to this field, though it has become saturated, like most fields nowadays. <br>

                            <b style="color: #272727;">I'm a general transcriptionist</b>. I'm not really "qualified" in
                            general transcription. This field
                            usually requires somebody who is self-taught, and this is often done in the form of
                            freelance, not full-time employment, though there are some
                            really loyal clients who stick around for many years. I receive audio/video from a client,
                            then I type what is being said in the audio/video. This requires patience, the ability to
                            tell
                            different voices apart, proofread, and have a
                            strict understanding of transcription style guides/standards. Even though AI has been
                            disrupting the job
                            market these past few years, human transcription is still a high-in-demand skill.<br><br>

                            My Hobbies, And Autism:</p>
                        <p style="color: #272727; margin-left: 2rem; margin-right: 2rem; margin-top: 2rem">
                            I have an ridiculous list of random interests and skills. Where most people are satisfied
                            with
                            having fun on weekends with their friends, I am sitting alone in my room with tonnes of
                            things to keep my introverted and socially anxious brain busy, from managing this
                            personal website of mine, to making SVG graphics, making PDF documents for fun (Yes, I'm
                            serious), farting around with music production,
                            learning a programming language, trying out a new operating system, painting, drawing, etc.
                            I can carry on for ages. It often
                            gets overwhelming managing all these hobbies, especially when I am pressured as an adult to
                            fit in with society, and make money. I suffer from something called "shiny object syndrome".
                            This is a common struggle for autistic people. I
                            constantly journal new thoughts, emotions, ideas, and I take screenshots of useful nuggets
                            of information for who knows when it'll actually be useful. I would hyperfocus on my current
                            interest, talking about it to my family (And most likely boring
                            them to death), then, I abandon it temporarily for the next interest. I have learned a lot
                            of programs,
                            problem-solving skills, etc. by dabbling into many different fields.
                            <br><br>
                            Unfortunately, I don't fit in with society (I struggle to talk like normal people, maintain
                            normal eye
                            contact, have "soft skills" for basic jobs that people usually find super easy, read social
                            cues, be socially active and invested,
                            maintain normal body language, etc. I am socially anxious, and I am too honest with people,
                            which can be harmful in corporate environments). Because of my autistic
                            traits, I easily get rejected from the most important things in life (Job
                            opportunities, friendships, and relationships). I have been diagnosed with serious
                            depression due to my struggles trying to be a normal human like everyone else. The
                            popular saying goes, "Autistic people live life on hard mode". And it's true. There isn't
                            enough awareness
                            surrounding autism, and people can often be very cruel and dismissive towards people like
                            us. So this
                            website of mine should hopefully serve as a tool for me to take matters into my own hands.
                            So if
                            you've read this far, I thank you for your patience. Please consider supporting someone like
                            me. We
                            are very smart people (I hate to call myself that), but we are often denied the chance to
                            participate in society. If you want to hire me for a job position, I will gladly take it,
                            and even help you as a friend beyond the original job description. Seriously, I can do many
                            things within my autistic limitations.
