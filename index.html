            <h1 class="text3" style="margin: 1rem; color: #ffffff;">HI;
            </h1>
            <p class="text2" style="margin-left: 1rem; margin-right: 1rem; color: #c3c3c3;">
                I'm <b style="color: #ffffff;">Warren Van Zuydam</b>. This is
                my
                personal space, where I can
                host
                my portfolio, display my skills, sell my digital products, offer freelance services, and more. If
                you are looking
                to interview/hire me,
                then
                get in touch with me on my contact page. <br>
                This website was built from the ground up in plain HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript. So if you want a website of your own, then feel free to send me an email. I am
                self-taught in web dev and design, but I still have a LOT to learn. I don't know stuff like
                WordPress, React, Node.js, Vue, etc. - just the basics to create a responsive website. <br>
                I am somebody
                who likes to dabble into many random things involving computers, from making websites, learning
                programming languages, installing different operating systems, doing graphic design, making fonts
                from scratch, and much, <i>much</i> more. Unfortunately, because I frequently jump interests, I cannot
                specialise in one of them. I feel that casting a wider net is more beneficial in today's economy,
                especially now with the threat of AI, but having many random skills is a double-edged sword. I have no
                idea which
                lifestyle path is more beneficial for me, but I really like to learn new things about computers. One
                day, I'm a
                Python coder, and the next day, I'm creating an interactive PDF ebook in LibreOffice Draw... or I'm
                coding a website.
            </p>
            <h1 class="text2" style="margin: 1rem; color: #ffffff;">WHAT I AIM TO GET OUT OF THIS PERSONAL WEBSITE
            </h1>
            <p class="text2" style="margin-left: 1rem; margin-right: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #c3c3c3;">
                I hope someone will take notice of my list of random skills and interests, and perhaps find a way to
                make use of me in their business. I hope to get hired either as a freelancer, or better, a full-time
                employee. I don't really care what I do, but I need something to get my life going. For a long time,
                I struggled to settle on one interest to become a master at it, in order to be able to turn it into
                a
                living. I am always thinking "What if I did this instead? This looks cool and interesting". As you can
                tell by now, I have a severe case of "Shiny Object Syndrome".
            </p>
            <h1 class="text2" style="margin: 1rem; color: #ffffff;">WHAT TYPE OF WORK WILL I DO?
            </h1>
            <p class="text2" style="margin-left: 1rem; margin-right: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #c3c3c3;">
                I will take almost anything at this point, from cleaning hotel rooms, doing spreadsheets, stocking
                shelves, etc. Web design is only a hobby of mine, and I know that many computer-centered fields are
                under threat by Artificial Intelligence, and other powerful automated tools.

                AutoCAD, Tekla, Revit, and
                Microstation. Unfortunately, I don't have access to this software, so this field has been difficult
                to get into, because of the expensive, proprietary software, and fierce competition. Finding
                practice projects, and getting feedback from other experienced draughtsmen is very hard, especially
                for someone as heavily introverted as me.

                <b style="color: #000000;">I'm a general transcriptionist</b>. I receive audio/video from a client,
                then I type what is being said in the audio/video. This requires patience, the ability to tell
                different voices apart, proofread, and have a
                strict understanding of transcription style guides/standards. This is luckily one of those fields
                where AI
                still sucks, and probably always will suck. If you need audio/video transcribed, then get in touch
                with me.
