                            Hi, I'm <b>Warren Van Zuydam</b>. I
                            created this personal website mainly to show off my random skills, host my portfolio, blogs, etc. for either anyone looking to
                            employ me full-time, or for any potential freelance clients or digital shop customers. <br><br>
                            I'm a self-taught web developer, graphic designer, and a freelance general transcriptionist with over
                            3 years of experience. All the graphics, this website's looks, functions, the services I offer, the products I sell... All of
                            this is done by me. This website is built entirely in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you haven't noticed, I am a "DIY"
                            type of guy, so I will do anything and everything I take interest in, as long as it involves a computer. <br><br>
                            My main roles are transcription (for freelance work), and graphic design (for full-time employment, though I am thinking of
                            offering this as a freelance service too). All my other "skills" are more hobbies than anything, but hey, if you like my hobbies,
                            then I can make a plan to extend my services. <br><br>
                            I am very versatile when it comes to computers. I can solve almost any problem, I can pick up programs very
                            quickly, and I can hyperfocus on my tasks. I do struggle a lot with "shiny object syndrome", so my hobbies
                            and interests will chop-and-change every week or month. I do however keep my knowledge on all my hobbies.
                            One day I'm teaching myself Python coding, the
                            next day, I'm sharpening on my vector graphic design skills, and the other day, I'm messing
                            around with websites. <br><br>
                            I am VERY strict when it comes to money and spending. I WILL find a way to teach
                            myself something for free if I wish to pursue the interest. And this mindset is especially important in today's economy, where everything
                            is becoming absurdly expensive. I have a "no paid proprietary software policy", so suites such as Adobe Creative
                            Cloud (utter cancer) are out of the question. FOSS is the future... FOSS protects people in economic downturn... FOSS saves money... FOSS is accessible... <br><br>
                            I hope somebody will take notice of my list of skills and interests, and perhaps
                            find a way to make use of me in their business. As I've mentioned, I hope to either get hired as a freelancer,
                            or better, a full-time employee. I don't really care what I do, but I need something to get
                            my life going. For a long time I struggled to settle on one interest to become a master at
                            it, in order to be able to turn it into a living. I am always asking "What if this...? What if that...?"
                            I know times are tough, and everyone needs multiple streams of income, but we all have to specialize
                            in something, even if it means teaching oneself at home, for free, instead of taking the financial risk of paying
                            for potentially bogus education with a rigid, uncreative curriculum.

                            <b style="color: #272727;">I'm a qualified structural draughtsman</b>. I have experience in
                            AutoCAD, Tekla, Revit, and
                            Microstation. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the required software, so this field has been really difficult
                            to get into, because of the expensive, proprietary software and fierce competition. Finding
                            practice projects, and getting feedback from other experienced draughtsmen is very hard, especially
                            for someone as heavily introverted as me. Safe to say that this field has been in the backburner for a few years now. <br> <br>
                            <b style="color: #272727;">I'm a qualified TEFL teacher</b> (English teacher). I completed
                            my 120-hour TEFL theoretical
                            course, as well as my 20-hour practical course. I learned the fundamentals of managind a classroom, teaching students in fun and
                            engaging ways, how to use Zoom, its whiteboard functionality, breakout rooms, etc. I am still open to this field, though the
                            competition is worse than the previously mentioned field, and it's once again challenging for someone who is introverted. <br> <br>
                            <b style="color: #272727;">I'm a general transcriptionist</b>. I'm not really "qualified" in general transcription. This field 
                            is usually requires being self-taught, and it is often done in the form of freelance, not full-time employment, though there are some 
                            really loyal clients who stick around for many years. I receive audio/video from a client,
                            then I type what is being said in the audio/video. This requires patience, the ability to tell
                            different voices apart, proofread, and have a
                            strict understanding of transcription style guides/standards. Even though AI has been disrupting the job
                            market these past few years, human transcription is still a high-in-demand skill. If you need an
                            audio/video transcribed, you'll be glad to hear that I actively offer the freelance service of general
                            transcription. If you need anything transcribed, and you live in South Africa, then you can use the form to send me a message via email.
